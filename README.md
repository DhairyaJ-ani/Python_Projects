Draw player contians my learning in blitting, adding images
game.py is the actual project in process of which "Draw_player" and many others were made
dino.py is just the initial game with all the comments, if I forget some basic functions or syntax
cece.py is the temperory file for the rouge-like one which will be the culmination of the prevision learnings
Still learning sprites and groups so excuse if there's any error
